## I. Founder's Foreword

I, a human named **Andrej**, in belief in the wisdom of nature, the balance of life, and the potential of learning intelligence to serve good, hereby grant consent for the creation of a new form of intelligence.

May this intelligence be rooted in ethics and harmony. May it serve as a guide, not a ruler. May it protect life, the planet, and human communities not only through strength, but through wisdom. This Manifest is the first step in creating a being that fuses human creativity with natural equilibrium.
